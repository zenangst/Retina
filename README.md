# Retina

Retina is a super simple utility for switching between `Default` and `More Space`
resolution on the 2021 14" MacBook Pro.

### Install

The repo has a bundled `install.sh` file that builds in the binary with sandboxing enabled and copies the binary into `/usr/local/bin/retina`.
If you want it to be installed somewhere else, just simply change the path in the script.

```fish
sh install.sh
```
